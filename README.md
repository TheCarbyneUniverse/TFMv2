# TFMv2

Format your time with ease and flexibility.

## Installation Methods
### Method 1 (Roblox Model)
Simply acquire the [Roblox model](https://www.roblox.com/library/6598240995/TFMv2-Time-Formatting-Module-version-2) (only contains the module script).


### Method 2 (.rbxmx File)

The file comes with a test script (to showcase all the functions of the module with comments) and a ScreenGui containing actual timer elements.

```
- TFMv2 [Folder]
    - TFMv2 [ModuleScript]
    - TestScript [LocalScript]
    - TFMv2 Showcase [ScreenGui]
```

Download the .rbxmx file from the latest version in the [releases page](https://github.com/TheCarbyneUniverse/TFMv2/releases). From the folder, move the module script to `ReplicatedStorage` and the local script and ScreenGui both into `StarterGui`.

### Method 3 (Filesystem)

Download this repository. Merge the `src` directory with yours. The `default.project.json` file places the GUI elements and the scripts in their respective locations, so you may merge that with your own project file.
